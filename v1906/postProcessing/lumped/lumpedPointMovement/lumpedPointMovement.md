## Discription from [lumpedPointMovement.C](lumpedPointMovement.C)

```
Description
    This utility can be used to produce VTK files to visualize the response
    points/rotations and the corresponding movement of the building surfaces.

    Uses the tabulated responses from the specified file.
    Optionally, it can also be used to a dummy responder for the
    externalFileCoupler logic, which makes it useful as a debugging facility
    as well demonstrating how an external application could communicate
    with the lumpedPointMovement point-patch boundary condition.
