Description
    View factors are calculated based on a face agglomeration array
    (finalAgglom generated by faceAgglomerate utility).

    Each view factor between the agglomerated faces i and j (Fij) is calculated
    using a double integral of the sub-areas composing the agglomeration.

    The patches involved in the view factor calculation are taken from the
    boundary file and should be part on the group viewFactorWall. ie.:

    floor
    {
        type            wall;
        inGroups        2(wall viewFactorWall);
        nFaces          100;
        startFace       3100;
    }


```
