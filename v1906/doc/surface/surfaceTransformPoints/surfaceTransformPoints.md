Description
    Transform (scale/rotate) a surface.
    Like transformPoints but for surfaces.

    The rollPitchYaw and yawPitchRoll options take three angles (degrees)
    that describe the intrinsic Euler rotation.

    rollPitchYaw
    - roll (rotation about X) followed by
    - pitch (rotation about Y) followed by
    - yaw (rotation about Z)

    yawPitchRoll
    - yaw (rotation about Z) followed by
    - pitch (rotation about Y) followed by
    - roll (rotation about X)
