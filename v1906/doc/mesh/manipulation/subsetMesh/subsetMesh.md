```
Description
    Create a mesh subset for a particular region of interest based on a
    cellSet or cellZone.

    See setSet/topoSet utilities on how to define select cells based on
    various shapes.

    Will subset all points, faces and cells needed to make a sub-mesh,
    but not preserve attached boundary types.
