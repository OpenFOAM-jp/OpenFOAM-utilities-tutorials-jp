Description
    Convert .msh file generated by the Adventure system.

    Note: the .msh format does not contain any boundary information. It is
    purely a description of the internal mesh.

    Can read both linear-tet format (i.e. 4 verts per tet) and linear-hex
    format (8 verts per hex) (if provided with the -hex (at your option)
    (Note: will bomb out if not supplied with the correct option for the
     file format)

    Not extensively tested.
