# patchSummary

```
Description
    Write field and boundary condition info for each patch at each requested
    time instance.

    Default action is to write a single entry for patches/patchGroups with the
    same boundary conditions. Use the -expand option to print every patch
    separately. In case of multiple groups matching it will print only the
    first one.
