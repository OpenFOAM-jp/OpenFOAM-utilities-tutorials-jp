## Discription from [zipUpMesh.C](zipUpMesh.C)

```
Description
    Reads in a mesh with hanging vertices and 'zips' up the cells
    to guarantee that all polyhedral cells of valid shape are closed.

    Meshes with hanging vertices may occur as a result of split
    hex mesh conversion or integration or coupled math face pairs.
