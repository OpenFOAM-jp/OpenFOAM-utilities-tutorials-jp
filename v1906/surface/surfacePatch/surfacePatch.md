## Discription from [surfacePatch.C](surfacePatch.C)

```
Description
    Patches (regionises) a surface using a user-selectable method.

    The current methods are either based on a geometric feature angle
    (a replacement for the surfaceAutoPatch functionality) or on intersecting
    a set of searchableSurfaces - this will re-triangulate the intersecting
    triangles and regonise the resulting triangles according to being
    inside/outside the surface.
